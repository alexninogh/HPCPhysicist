# HPC for Physicists from a Physicist

My name is [Alessandro Renzi](https://github.com/alexninogh/alessandro.renzi), and I am a physicist working on cosmology and data analysis. This repository aims to be a collection of notes on HPC and numerical computing, with the hope that it will be useful for others using HPC in physics.

## Learning by Teaching

Best way to learn is by teaching! -> Read about [Feynman technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching).

Here you can find my collection of notes:

- [Utilities](./utils/utils-index.md): Random notes about programming
- [Programming with Julia](./julia/julia-index.md): How to start developing with the Julia programming language.
- [Parallel Programming](./parallel_prog/pp-index.md): Learn to do parallel programming
