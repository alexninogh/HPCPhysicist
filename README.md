# HPC for Physicists from a Physicist :D

My name is [Alessandro Renzi](https://github.com/alexninogh/alessandro.renzi), I am a physicist working on cosmology and data analysis. This repository wants to be a collection of notes about HPC and numerical computing, with the hope of being useful for others using HPC for physics.
